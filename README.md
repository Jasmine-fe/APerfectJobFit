- **Match Score**

  ```python
  inputText = [resumeText, jobDesciptionText]
  cv = CountVectorizer()
  count_matrix = cv.fit_transform(inputText)
  matchPercentage = round(cosine_similarity(count_matrix)[0][1] * 100, 2)
  print(f"[ Resume Match Score ]\n{matchPercentage}")
  ```
  output
  ```
  MatchScore: 58.98 ðŸ˜…
  ```

  keywords(despText, ratio=0.1)
  ```
  output
  ```
